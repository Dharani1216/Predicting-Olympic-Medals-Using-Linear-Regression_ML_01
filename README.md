# Predicting-Olympic-Medals-Using-Linear-Regression_ML_01

# Introduction
The Olympics, held every four years, bring nations together in a spectacular showcase of athletic prowess. But what if we could predict how many medals a country will win in future games? In this project, I aimed to tackle this question by building several machine learning models, starting with Linear Regression, to predict the number of medals a country might win, based on historical Olympic data.
Using a dataset that includes factors like the number of athletes in each team, past medal counts, and other relevant features, I explored different approaches to make accurate medal predictions. By analyzing the data and applying models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest, I was able to make predictions and evaluate their effectiveness.
The results reveal which factors play a key role in a country's Olympic success and provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model when forecasting future performances.
