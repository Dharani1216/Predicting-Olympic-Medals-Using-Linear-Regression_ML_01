# Predicting Olympic Medals with Machine Learning

## Introduction
The Olympics, held every four years, bring nations together in a spectacular showcase of athletic prowess. But what if we could predict how many medals a country will win in future games? This project builds several machine learning models, starting with Linear Regression, to predict the number of medals a country might win, based on historical Olympic data. I explore various models such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest, while evaluating their accuracy in predicting medals.
